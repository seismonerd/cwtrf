Receiver function deconvolution based on continuous wavelet transform convolution theorem

[The convolution theorem for the continuous wavelet tranform](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165168403002159)

Receiver function deconvolution in the frequency domain might be deconvolved by *scale*, i.e. a different damping or *water-level* could be used for each scale.
